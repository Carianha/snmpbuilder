General

Giapnguyen writed the tool because was tired in create SNMP items for zabbix. To create a useful zabbix's template for SNMP devices, he used to open a MIB browser to get correct OID then fill the zabbix's item form. There is a first attempt of work out this problem, zload_snmpwalk http://zabbix.com/wiki/howto/monitor/snmp/zload_snmpwalk. But this new one is a GUI tool.

SNMP builder is a add-in for Zabbix. It provide browse MIB for values and informations, automatically convert into Zabbix items and insert them into a template.

The last Zabbix version tested was 1.8.4

FEATURES:

    * MIB Browser: you can select default MIB files or your own device MIBs to get OID tree. Click on the tree to retrieve value and information about a OID. Click to select the OID as Zabbix's item.
    * OID Table support: it assume that a OID whose name's end with string 'Table' is a OID Table. OID Table will retrieve with all it's indexes. Click on the cell to select the index as Zabbix's item. If the table has not a 'Table' ending, use the checkbox .view as table.
    * Column selection: On OID Table, click on a header will select a whole column as Zabbix's items (e.g. It's useful if you create SNMP template for a 48 ports switch).
    * Auto mapping: Add the mapping value-stringDescription from the chose item, when it is of type Integer, to the list of mappings in Zabbix. 

(Version number of snmpbuilder equalls zabbix version for that it works.)

CHANGE LOG:

SnmpBuilder 1.8.4
    * Added auto mapping checkbox.
    * Fix loading of JS files.
    * Fix "Save" button to work in 1.8.4.
    * Fix the issue of escaping data passed to the underlying snmp commands, replacing double quotes with escaped ones. 
    * Fix for missing MIB trees, where snmp_builder.php options to snmptable are listed in the wrong sequence. 
    * Allow using of the different SNMP port instead of default 161 one in the Server: text box file snmp_builder.php 
    * Replaced the commas with "@@@" as field delimiter.

SnmpBuilder 1.8.1

    * Fix undefined index warnings.
    * Include danrog's fix for non-numeric indexes.
    * From 1.8.1, zabbix not accept specified chars in key name. So I must replace them with underscore.


INSTALATION

1. Unzip snmp_builder.zip into zabbix's web root. There is a snmp_builder.php and 3 js files under sump_builder sub-dir.
2. Open snmp_builder.php, edit MIBS_ALL_PATH for your own SNMP MIB's directories.

define('MIBS_ALL_PATH', '/home/zabbix/public_html/snmp_builder/mibs:/usr/share/snmp/mibs');

3. Open include/menu.inc.php. At line 203, insert a piece of code

                                  array('url'=>'snmp_builder.php',
						'label'=>'SNMP Builder'
					),

Like this:

		                      'label'=>S_NOTIFICATIONS
					),
				array('url'=>'locales.php',
						'label'=>S_LOCALES
					),
				array('url'=>'snmp_builder.php',
						'label'=>'SNMP Builder'
					),
				array('url'=>'instal.php',
						'label'=>S_INSTALLATION,
						'sub_pages'=>array('setup.php','warning.php')
					)
				)

It for integrate snmp_builder.php as a menu item under Administration tab and between Locales and Install menu. In fact, you can add it in any place.


4. Make sure php-pecl-json is installed (it is for CentOS I think)
5. Make sure NetSNMP is installed 
6. Test snmp access to your device from the command-line.
Ex: 

#> snmpget -LE 2 -v 2c -c community -M /usr/share/snmp/mibs -m ALL deviceIP iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr.0 

RFC1213-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: "Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-IPBASEK9-M), Version 12.4(12c), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport
Copyright (c) 1986-2007 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
Compiled Fri 13-Jul-07 00:56 by prod_rel_team"

7. Verify MIB dependences in the MIB directory (snmptranslate)
8. Open Zabbix, select Administation tab, you should see SNMP Builder in menu.
9. Test snmp loading of the MIB file. Many MIBs are actually broken from the start and need to be fixed.



TODO

    * Search OID: Sometimes I'm tired to dig into OID tree to find a OID. Why don't search it?
    * Edit item lists: Auto convert not work every cases. Why don't edit item's params (unit, delta, interval) before submit to Zabbix?
    * Detect default mib directory (edit MIB_ALL_PATH no more)
